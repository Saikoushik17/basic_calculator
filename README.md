# basic_calculator
For the calculator project, I used Python functions to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. User input was collected using `input()`, and control flow (`if`, `elif`, `else`) directed the program based on the user's choice. I also included error handling for division by zero, ensuring the application is both functional and user-friendly.
